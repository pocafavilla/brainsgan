Trying to use GANs to increase the resolution of MRI scans for my internship at Juelich research center

This is an experiment that I started mostly out of curiosity. I do not know for certain if it will work. 
However, SRGANs have been applied to normal images and vastly outperformed conventional upscaling methods so I thought I'd give it a shot.

I do not want to obfuscate the fact that I am relying to a large extend on other people's code and especially research papers. 
I will start mentioning sources once the first persentable results are generated but that might take a while.
